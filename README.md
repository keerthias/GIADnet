# GIADnet: Graph-based Intracranial Aneurysm Detection Network with Spectral Convolution

 GIADnet follows a non-Euclidean-based computing approach for aneurysm detection that uses graph-based learning to capture long-range dependencies and  learn rich representations of the cerebrovascular system. It utilizes sparsity information in the spectral domain to identify localized events in the graph structure, which can serve as strong indicators of aneurysms.
